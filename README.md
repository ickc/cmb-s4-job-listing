- [BICEP winter overs, until filled](#bicep)
- [Postdoc at NIST, until filled](#nist)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**[BICEP winter overs, until filled](https://hr.myu.umn.edu/psc/hrprd/EMPLOYEE/HRMS/c/HRS_HRAM_FL.HRS_CG_SEARCH_FL.GBL?Page=HRS_APP_JBPST_FL&Action=U&SiteId=1&FOCUS=Applicant&JobOpeningId=355090&PostingSeq=1&)**

The BICEP winter-over scientists will start work in fall 2023 and deploy to the South Pole via New Zealand in late October or early November. They will remain at the South Pole through the Antarctic winter, until November 2024. Once the austral summer team leaves the site in February 2024, the two-person winter-over team is responsible for maintaining and operating the BICEP telescopes while science data is being recorded.

The BICEP3 and BICEP Array telescopes represent an investment of approximately $30 million and 50-person years of effort by a collaboration of more than 30 people. The team plans carefully for every eventuality and many spare parts are kept on site. Nevertheless, the possibility for failure due to human error exists and has occurred in the past. Poor judgment or decision-making could result in the experiment being interrupted for the remainder of the winter season, resulting in major implied costs and loss of scientific competitiveness. The winter-over scientists will receive considerable support and guidance via internet and satellite telephone communications. Nevertheless, these roles requires exceptionally stable individuals who are self-motivated and able to communicate and take direction well.

**[Postdoc at NIST, until filled](https://jobs.colorado.edu/jobs/JobDetail/?jobId=44413)**

The Professional Research Experience Program (PREP) encourages applications for a Postdoctoral Associate/Research Associate! The Long-wavelength Project within the Quantum Sensors Group in the Quantum Electromagnetics Division on NIST’s Physical Measurement Laboratory seeks a researcher to join a multi-person team to develop microwave kinetic inductance detectors and other novel devices for applications at millimeter to far-infrared wavelengths.
