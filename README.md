**[Staff Physicists at Argonne National Laboratory, Oct 31, 2021](https://jobregister.aas.org/ad/5e2f8de1)**

The Cosmological Physics and Advanced Computing (CPAC) Group in the High Energy Physics (HEP) division at Argonne National Laboratory is seeking a highly qualified candidate in the area of cosmic microwave background (CMB) instrumentation and data analysis to contribute to current projects including SPT-3G and CMB-S4, as well as to develop future opportunities.

The successful candidate must have a PhD in physics or related fields and appropriate postdoctoral experience. Areas of technical expertise include cryogenic receiver design and operation, superconducting detector and readout system design and implementation, CMB receiver integration and commissioning, and CMB data analysis ranging from low-level processing, instrumental systematics verification to cosmological constraints. Experience with high performance computing and AI/ML expertise would be helpful. A demonstrated record of student and/or postdoctoral mentorship and proposal writing, along with strong oral and written communication skills, is highly desirable. The selected candidate will work in a highly collaborative environment within CPAC, HEP division, and Argonne National Laboratory, and with academia and other national laboratories.  CPAC hosts wide-ranging programs in theory, modeling, and simulation and in experiment and observation focusing on optical and CMB surveys, including CMB-S4, DES, DESI, Rubin Observatory’s LSST, SPHEREx, and SPT-3G.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**[Postdoctoral Position at KIPAC, Stanford/SLAC, Nov 1, 2021](https://academicjobsonline.org/ajo/jobs/19563)**

Applications are invited for several postdoctoral positions at the Kavli Institute of Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology (KIPAC) at Stanford University and the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory with a focus on Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) surveys. The positions are primarily intended to expand our work with the CMB experiments BICEP/Keck Array, the South Pole Telescope (SPT), Simons Observatory, and CMB-S4, but also to develop applications and methods in other areas of cosmology and physics.

We seek candidates with experience in data analysis, simulations, and/or instrumentation development in observational cosmology or particle astrophysics, and expect them to work in one or more of the following areas:

1\. Science analyses of data from current-generation CMB experiments, and if relevant, jointly with data from surveys such as DESI, Rubin Observatory, or intensity mapping experiments.

2\. Forecasts and systematics studies informing the design of CMB-S4.

3\. Development of CMB-S4 instrumentation prototypes and software, especially in the area of superconducting transition-edge sensors and their SQUID-amplified readout.

4\. Application of CMB detector and readout technology in new concepts for low-mass dark matter searches, THz photon sensing, and qubit-based sensors for physics.

Successful candidates will have ample opportunities to test their ideas on data from the South Pole Telescope and the BICEP/Keck Array telescopes, and to make significant contributions to the design of the next-generation CMB experiment CMB-S4. They will work with CMB scientists in the aforementioned collaborations and interact with the local CMB and cosmology groups, making connections to other exciting opportunities for measurements in cosmology and physics. KIPAC provides a stimulating intellectual environment for interactions with scientists pursuing observational, experimental, computational, and theoretical research relevant to the above areas.

The Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology (KIPAC) at Stanford University seeks recent Ph.D. scientists for a postdoctoral research position in Galactic magnetism and interstellar medium science. Candidates should have or expect to receive a Ph.D. in astronomy or physics prior to starting their appointment. Knowledge of the interstellar medium, astrophysical magnetic fields, or polarization data will be an asset. Candidates with a strong background in other astronomical data analysis and an interest in learning more about interstellar magnetic fields are also encouraged to apply. The successful candidate will join the Cosmic Magnetism & Interstellar Physics Group at Stanford, a group of researchers working on a diverse set of problems involving Galactic and extragalactic magnetism, 3D ISM structure, interstellar turbulence, star formation, and polarized cosmological foregrounds, among other topics. There will also be the opportunity to work on Galactic science with CMB experiment data. KIPAC is playing a leading role in CMB experiments including BICEP/Keck Array, the South Pole Telescope, the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, LiteBIRD, Ali, Simons Observatory, and planning for CMB-S4.

KIPAC offers significant computational resources for data analysis, and also provides the opportunity to participate in cross-disciplinary activities through the Stanford Data Science Initiative. This position offers excellent benefits (<https://postdocbenefits.stanford.edu/>) and salary, and the appointment will be made for a term of three years. Please contact [Susan Clark](https://kipac.stanford.edu/people/susan-clark) for more information on this position.
