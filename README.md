[Postdoc on RadioForegroundsPlus at Instituto de Fisica de Cantabria, Jan 31, 2024 until filled](https://research.iac.es/proyecto/radioforegroundsplus/pages/jobs.php)

The Observational Cosmology and Instrumentation Group of the Instituto de FiÃÅsica de Cantabria (IFCA; Santander, Spain) offers one postdoctoral position to work on the RadioForegroundsPlus project of the Horizon Europe Program (Grant Agreement number 101135036). All the relevant information about the project (including other job opportunities) can be found at:

https://research.iac.es/proyecto/radioforegroundsplus/

The aim of the project is to provide the best possible characterization of the physical properties of polarized emissions in the microwave domain, together with an unprecedentedly thorough description of the intensity signal. This legacy information will be essential for future sub-orbital or satellite experiments targeting the B-Mode of Cosmic Microwave Anisotropies for the measurement of background of primordial gravitational waves. The project is coordinated by IFCA-CSIC and it also includes IAC (Spain), SISSA (Italy), CNRS (France), Univ. of Oxford (UK) and Univ. of Manchester (UK). Postdoc positions are expected to be available at all nodes.

The successful candidate is expected to work in the development and application of advanced tools for component separation with the aim to provide foreground maps and catalogues of point sources from low frequency surveys (QUIJOTE, C-BASS, S-PASS) in conjunction with Planck, WMAP and other ancillary data. Experience on component separation (using e.g. parametric methods, linear techniques or machine learning) is particularly desirable. The candidate will closely work with other members of the group and, in particular, with Dr. BeleÃÅn Barreiro and Dr. Mathieu Remazeilles. Collaboration with researchers from other nodes of the project is also expected.

**[Postdoc in CMB Research at IJCLab, Mar 1, 2024](https://inspirehep.net/jobs/2748994)**

The¬†[CMB team](https://a2c.ijclab.in2p3.fr/a2c-home-fr/cmb-home-en/)¬†at the Ir√®ne Joliot-Curie 2 Infinities Physics Laboratory (IJCLab) is offering a post-doc position as part of the ‚ÄúIN2P3 Fellowships des 2 infinis‚Äù program.

¬†

The team is made up of 4 permanent researchers (2 research directors, 1 research fellow and 1 lecturer), a post-doctoral student and a PhD student, and specialises in the analysis and scientific exploitation of cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements. The team‚Äôs researchers study the observational constraints on the Standard Model of Cosmology (ùõ¨CDM) and its extensions, the neutrino sector, reionisation, dark matter, and inflationary models. Having played an active part in Planck, its members are now involved in the Simons Observatory (first light expected in 2024) and CMB-S4 (first light in 2034) ground-based experiments, and in the future LiteBIRD space mission (launch planned for 2033).

¬†

The team brings together a wide range of skills in the processing and interpretation of CMB data, with internationally recognised expertise in estimators of angular spectra, likelihood functions and phenomenological studies linked to inflation, the neutrino sector and gravitational lensing effects. The team would like to strengthen its expertise in the analysis and interpretation of CMB data, both on large scales (Planck, LiteBIRD) and on the ground (Simons-Observatory and preparation for CMB-S4).

**[Postdoc in experimental cosmology at UCR, Apr 30, 2024, until filled](https://academicjobsonline.org/ajo/jobs/27217)**

The Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of California, Riverside (UCR) seeks applications for a postdoctoral position for research in experimental/observational cosmology. This search is a part of a new experimental effort being built at UCR in the general areas of cosmological sciences (gravitational wave, dark matter, neutrino, CMB, and more), currently consisting of Barry Barish, Steve Choi, Jon Richardson, and Shawn Westerdale, and continuing to grow (with new faculty searches ongoing). The theory group is represented by Yanou Cui, Flip Tanedo, Hai-Bo Yu, Simeon Bird, Anson D‚ÄôAloisio, and Laura Sales.¬†

The selected candidate will primarily work with Choi‚Äôs group in developing and commissioning new instruments and/or data analyses for a combination of astronomical observatories, including the CCAT Observatory, Atacama Cosmology Telescope, Simons Observatory, and CMB-S4. The initial appointment is for 2 years with possibility for renewal based on satisfactory performance and continued funding. Applicants should have a Ph.D. in physics, astrophysics, or a related field, with experience in astronomical instrumentation and/or cosmological data analyses.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**[Postdoc at Duke University, until filled](https://academicjobsonline.org/ajo/jobs/26059)**

The cosmology group at Duke University invites applications for a postdoctoral position in the area of cosmology (experimental, observational and theoretical), time-domain and galaxy cluster astrophysics, and new techniques in statistical and image analysis. The cosmology group is composed of Profs. Arun Kannawadi, Dan Scolnic, Michael Troxel, Eve Vavagiakis and Chris Walter, working on current and next generation experiments, including CCAT, CMB-S4, the Dark Energy Survey, Hyper-Suprime Cam Subaru Strategic Program, the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, the Rubin Observatory LSST, and the Simons Observatory. The Duke cosmology group currently consists of about ten PhD students and four postdocs or research scientists, and will continue to grow and expand. We are committed to building a group that is inclusive and representative of our community. For this reason, we strongly encourage applicants who come from groups that are historically underrepresented in physics departments.

This researcher would work with Prof. Eve Vavagiakis to support CCAT, the Simons Observatory, and/or CMB-S4, with opportunities for joint analyses with data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope and optical surveys. The researcher will lead and contribute to projects in a variety of potential topics, including the development of new instrumentation and superconducting detector technologies for upcoming surveys, and pipeline development and data analysis for cosmology and astrophysics. Candidates are expected to be experienced with relevant instrumentation (cryogenics, mechanical design, low-temperature electronics, superconducting devices) and data analysis techniques in cosmology/millimeter or submillimeter wave astronomy, and to have strong oral and written communication skills.

The positions are funded by the PRIN project ‚ÄúBROWSEPOL: Beyond standaRd mOdel With coSmic¬†  
microwavE background POLarization‚Äù. BROWSEPOL aims at the theoretical and phenomenological¬†  
investigation of fundamental physics signatures beyond the standard cosmological model, including, e.g.,¬†  
signatures of parity violation arising in the context of Cosmic Birefringence or in other observables.¬†  
  
The¬†research¬†work will be focused on the development of theoretical models (related to inflationary or late¬†  
time universe physics) and new predictions of the corresponding CMB phenomenology, on the¬†  
implementation of new analysis techniques to CMB polarization data, as well as on the forecasts for next-  
generation CMB experiments focused on B-modes, including SO, CMB-S4 and LiteBIRD. ¬†
