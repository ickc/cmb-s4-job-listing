The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign invites applications for a postdoctoral position in experimental and observational cosmology. The successful candidate will join the research group of Professor Jeff Filippini, with a primary focus on one or more of the following efforts: (1) cryogenic camera development and commissioning for the Terahertz Intensity Mapper (TIM), a balloon-borne spectrometer that will make a path-breaking measurement of cosmic star formation history; (2) development of next-generation cosmic microwave background instruments, CMB-S4 and Taurus (a new ultra-long-duration balloon to measure reionization and Galactic foregrounds). Candidates may also participate in (and add to) broader analysis and instrumentation efforts within the group.
