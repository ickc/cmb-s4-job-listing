**[Faculty position at FCFM, University of Chile, Oct 10, 2023](https://concurso-academico.uchile.cl/Postulacion/FM2304)**

The Faculty of Physical and Mathematical Sciences at the University of Chile announces an exclusive competition for women to fill one academic position as a full-time (44 hrs.) regular career appointment in the Physics Department. This position is open to all areas of physics, and applicants working in cosmology, for instance CMB physics, are encouraged. Our department ([https://dfi.uchile.cl](https://dfi.uchile.cl/)) hosts a Cosmology Group with two professors (Domenico Sapone and Gonzalo Palma) and several graduate students. The position involves a strong commitment to research, both individual and collaborative, undergraduate and postgraduate teaching, and it is expected that the selected candidate will maintain an active connection with society in their respective field. All of this through research and development projects, participation in postgraduate courses or diplomas, and/or outreach activities.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**[QUP postdoctoral fellows for LiteBIRD, until filled](https://academicjobsonline.org/ajo/jobs/25277)**

 We seek candidates interested in cosmic microwave background experiments with extensive experience in cryogenic instrumentation. The successful candidates will work with QUP Senior Scientist and project manager of QUP’s LiteBIRD activity, Hiroki Akamatsu, whose research focuses on developing CMB instrumentation for JAXA’s L-class mission LiteBIRD aiming for primordial gravitational-wave search. Our postdoctoral fellows are for three years, with the possibility of a 2-year renewal based upon satisfactory job performance, continuing availability of funds, and ongoing operational needs, and are provided with salaries comparable to those at other prestigious institutions. We may offer a higher position, at the rank of assistant professor, for five years with the possibility of a 2-year renewal to outstanding candidates.

 The primary research topic of the new position is the construction and accurate characterization of the LiteBIRD low-frequency telescope Focal Plane Unit (FPU). The focal plane subassembly will be based on Transition Edge Sensors bolometers and Digital Frequency Multiplexing technology. We expect to build and characterize the prototype (demonstration model) by 2026. We seek ambitious, highly motivated, and result-driven scientists. Applicants should have a Ph.D. in Physics/Engineering or a related field by the time the appointment begins. Excellent cryogenics instrumentation experiences are essential. A good command of the English language is necessary, and the fellow should be able to work independently and in a team.
