**[Particle Physics and Astrophysics Faculty position at SLAC, Nov 28, 2022](https://jobregister.aas.org/ad/beb75d0d)**

The Particle Physics & Astrophysics (PPA) Department at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory/Stanford University seeks applicants for a tenure-track assistant professor appointment in any area of physics pursued by SLAC’s Cosmic Frontier program and the Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology (KIPAC). The successful applicant should demonstrate the potential to lead an outstanding experimental, observational, or theoretical research program in one or more of the areas of dark energy, dark matter, inflation, structure formation, or other emerging areas in the Cosmic Frontier. Additionally, they should possess good communication skills and a commitment to effective mentoring.

SLAC’s current program includes a broad theory program in particle astrophysics, cosmology, and fundamental physics; cosmology research with the Vera C. Rubin’s Observatory Legacy Survey of Space & Time, the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, and CMB-S4; and dark matter searches with LZ, Super-CDMS, Dark Matter Radio and a future G3 liquid Xenon experiment (see: https://www6.slac.stanford.edu/research/astrophysics-and-cosmology). We welcome candidates who would bring additional dimensions or directions to our program. A broad astrophysics and cosmology program at Stanford and SLAC is pursued under the auspices of the Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology; see [kipac.stanford.edu](http://kipac.stanford.edu).

Exceptional applicants at the associate or full professor level may also be considered, as well as applicants in other science areas pursued by SLAC’s PPA Department (see <https://www6.slac.stanford.edu/research>).

**[TCAPP postdoc fellowships at UT Austin, Dec 1, 2022](https://academicjobsonline.org/ajo/fellowship/23069)**

The newly established Texas Center for Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics (TCCAP) at The University of Texas at Austin invites applications for its first TCCAP Postdoctoral Fellowships, to start September 2023. The initial appointments are for two years, extendable to a third year, subject to availability of funding and satisfactory performance.

We anticipate 2 to 3 Fellowships in the area of theoretical cosmology, astrophysics, or astroparticle physics (e.g. dark matter, CMB, structure formation, galaxy formation, cosmic dawn, and the 21-cm background). One Fellow will be hired to work in Prof. Kimberly Boddy’s group, and another will be hired to work in Prof. Julian Muñoz’s group. There may be available funding for a separate third Fellowship. Contact Kimberly Boddy and Julian Muñoz ([\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection), [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)) for questions about these positions.

All TCCAP Fellows will benefit from interaction with TCCAP faculty (Kimberly Boddy, Mike Boylan-Kolchin, Volker Bromm, Katherine Freese, Nicholas Galitzki, Julian Muñoz, and Paul Shapiro) and join the excitement of a broad community of active researchers in cosmology and related physics and astrophysics, with additional members of the Physics and Astronomy Departments, including the Weinberg Theory Group, the Center for Gravitational Physics, and McDonald Observatory. Fellows will also have access to the world-class supercomputing facilities of the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC).

**[TCAPP postdoc fellowship for SO data analysis at UT Austin, Dec 1, 2022](https://academicjobsonline.org/ajo/fellowship/23072)**

The newly-established Texas Center for Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics (TCCAP) at The University of Texas at Austin invites applications for one of the inaugural TCCAP Postdoctoral Fellowships, to start September 2023. The candidate will be expected to play a leading role in early cosmological analysis of data from the Simons Observatory (SO), while being involved with other science of similar nature, such as learning about cosmology from a combination of large scale structure and CMB data. The initial appointment is for two years, extendable to a third year, subject to availability of funding and satisfactory performance.

The Fellow will be hired to work in close collaboration with Profs. Katherine Freese and Nicholas Galitzki.
