[Postdoc on RadioForegroundsPlus at Instituto de Fisica de Cantabria, Jan 31, 2024 until filled](https://research.iac.es/proyecto/radioforegroundsplus/pages/jobs.php)

The Observational Cosmology and Instrumentation Group of the Instituto de FiÃÅsica de Cantabria (IFCA; Santander, Spain) offers one postdoctoral position to work on the RadioForegroundsPlus project of the Horizon Europe Program (Grant Agreement number 101135036). All the relevant information about the project (including other job opportunities) can be found at:

https://research.iac.es/proyecto/radioforegroundsplus/

The aim of the project is to provide the best possible characterization of the physical properties of polarized emissions in the microwave domain, together with an unprecedentedly thorough description of the intensity signal. This legacy information will be essential for future sub-orbital or satellite experiments targeting the B-Mode of Cosmic Microwave Anisotropies for the measurement of background of primordial gravitational waves. The project is coordinated by IFCA-CSIC and it also includes IAC (Spain), SISSA (Italy), CNRS (France), Univ. of Oxford (UK) and Univ. of Manchester (UK). Postdoc positions are expected to be available at all nodes.

The successful candidate is expected to work in the development and application of advanced tools for component separation with the aim to provide foreground maps and catalogues of point sources from low frequency surveys (QUIJOTE, C-BASS, S-PASS) in conjunction with Planck, WMAP and other ancillary data. Experience on component separation (using e.g. parametric methods, linear techniques or machine learning) is particularly desirable. The candidate will closely work with other members of the group and, in particular, with Dr. BeleÃÅn Barreiro and Dr. Mathieu Remazeilles. Collaboration with researchers from other nodes of the project is also expected.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**[CAPS postdoctoral fellowship at UIUC, Feb 15, 2024](https://jobregister.aas.org/ad/c72e94b6)**

The Center for AstroPhysical Surveys (CAPS) at the National Center for Supercomputer Applications (NCSA) and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign invite applications from Ph.D. scientists for the CAPS postdoctoral fellowship. This independent fellowship is for 3 years and offers a competitive salary, benefits, and research funds.

This fellowship offers an opportunity to carry out independent research and to be connected with the vibrant research programs in astrophysics at the University of Illinois. Existing research programs at Illinois include the Dark Energy Survey (DES), Vera Rubin Observatory (Rubin) and the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), South Pole Telescope (SPT), and CMB-S4. NCSA leads data management and processing for the DES project with support from the National Science Foundation and is a partner in the construction and commissioning of Rubin. Illinois is an institutional member of the SPT collaboration and participates in the design and planning for CMB-S4.

The selected candidate will be part of the Center for Astrophysical Surveys (CAPS) at NCSA. NCSA is a hub of transdisciplinary research and digital scholarship where University of Illinois faculty, staff, and students, and collaborators from around the globe, unite to address research grand challenges for the benefit of science and society. There is a strong overlap and synergy between CAPS and the Departments of Astronomy and Physics. More information on CAPS can be found at [caps.ncsa.illinois.edu](http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/).

**[Postdoc in CMB Research at IJCLab, Mar 1, 2024](https://inspirehep.net/jobs/2748994)**

The¬†[CMB team](https://a2c.ijclab.in2p3.fr/a2c-home-fr/cmb-home-en/)¬†at the Ir√®ne Joliot-Curie 2 Infinities Physics Laboratory (IJCLab) is offering a post-doc position as part of the ‚ÄúIN2P3 Fellowships des 2 infinis‚Äù program.

¬†

The team is made up of 4 permanent researchers (2 research directors, 1 research fellow and 1 lecturer), a post-doctoral student and a PhD student, and specialises in the analysis and scientific exploitation of cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements. The team‚Äôs researchers study the observational constraints on the Standard Model of Cosmology (ùõ¨CDM) and its extensions, the neutrino sector, reionisation, dark matter, and inflationary models. Having played an active part in Planck, its members are now involved in the Simons Observatory (first light expected in 2024) and CMB-S4 (first light in 2034) ground-based experiments, and in the future LiteBIRD space mission (launch planned for 2033).

¬†

The team brings together a wide range of skills in the processing and interpretation of CMB data, with internationally recognised expertise in estimators of angular spectra, likelihood functions and phenomenological studies linked to inflation, the neutrino sector and gravitational lensing effects. The team would like to strengthen its expertise in the analysis and interpretation of CMB data, both on large scales (Planck, LiteBIRD) and on the ground (Simons-Observatory and preparation for CMB-S4).

**[Postdoc at Duke University, until filled](https://academicjobsonline.org/ajo/jobs/26059)**

The cosmology group at Duke University invites applications for a postdoctoral position in the area of cosmology (experimental, observational and theoretical), time-domain and galaxy cluster astrophysics, and new techniques in statistical and image analysis. The cosmology group is composed of Profs. Arun Kannawadi, Dan Scolnic, Michael Troxel, Eve Vavagiakis and Chris Walter, working on current and next generation experiments, including CCAT, CMB-S4, the Dark Energy Survey, Hyper-Suprime Cam Subaru Strategic Program, the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, the Rubin Observatory LSST, and the Simons Observatory. The Duke cosmology group currently consists of about ten PhD students and four postdocs or research scientists, and will continue to grow and expand. We are committed to building a group that is inclusive and representative of our community. For this reason, we strongly encourage applicants who come from groups that are historically underrepresented in physics departments.

This researcher would work with Prof. Eve Vavagiakis to support CCAT, the Simons Observatory, and/or CMB-S4, with opportunities for joint analyses with data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope and optical surveys. The researcher will lead and contribute to projects in a variety of potential topics, including the development of new instrumentation and superconducting detector technologies for upcoming surveys, and pipeline development and data analysis for cosmology and astrophysics. Candidates are expected to be experienced with relevant instrumentation (cryogenics, mechanical design, low-temperature electronics, superconducting devices) and data analysis techniques in cosmology/millimeter or submillimeter wave astronomy, and to have strong oral and written communication skills.
