**[Staff Physicists at Argonne National Laboratory, Oct 31, 2021](https://jobregister.aas.org/ad/5e2f8de1)**

The Cosmological Physics and Advanced Computing (CPAC) Group in the High Energy Physics (HEP) division at Argonne National Laboratory is seeking a highly qualified candidate in the area of cosmic microwave background (CMB) instrumentation and data analysis to contribute to current projects including SPT-3G and CMB-S4, as well as to develop future opportunities.

The successful candidate must have a PhD in physics or related fields and appropriate postdoctoral experience. Areas of technical expertise include cryogenic receiver design and operation, superconducting detector and readout system design and implementation, CMB receiver integration and commissioning, and CMB data analysis ranging from low-level processing, instrumental systematics verification to cosmological constraints. Experience with high performance computing and AI/ML expertise would be helpful. A demonstrated record of student and/or postdoctoral mentorship and proposal writing, along with strong oral and written communication skills, is highly desirable. The selected candidate will work in a highly collaborative environment within CPAC, HEP division, and Argonne National Laboratory, and with academia and other national laboratories.  CPAC hosts wide-ranging programs in theory, modeling, and simulation and in experiment and observation focusing on optical and CMB surveys, including CMB-S4, DES, DESI, Rubin Observatory’s LSST, SPHEREx, and SPT-3G.

**[Postdoc at University of Ferrara, Sep 30, 2021](https://academicjobsonline.org/ajo/jobs/19021)**

The Cosmology group at the Department of Physics and Earth Science, University of Ferrara (UNIFE), Italy, invites expressions of interest for a fixed-term staff position\* from outstanding candidates with a strong research record in cosmic microwave background (CMB) and large scale structure (LSS) data analysis and interpretation. The research topics include: pipeline development for next generation CMB experiments, cross-correlation of CMB data with large-scale-structure surveys, likelihood analysis, cosmological model building and investigation of fundamental physics with upcoming cosmological datasets.

The Cosmology group at UNIFE is active on several complementary aspects of the research in cosmology, covering a wide range of activities, from cosmo-particle projects with a mostly-theoretical flavour to the development and validation of data analysis pipelines. The group is deeply involved in several scientific collaborations such as LiteBIRD, Euclid, LSPE, Simons Observatory, CMB-S4.

**[Chamberlain Fellowships at LBNL, Oct 17, 2021](https://academicjobsonline.org/ajo/jobs/19306)**

The Physics Division of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory announces the competition for the 2022 Owen Chamberlain Fellowships in Experimental Particle Physics and Cosmology.

The Physics Division pursues a broad suite of experimental research.  It has a long tradition of advanced detector development, computational research (including a strong focus on machine learning) and a new initiative in quantum information science (both quantum computing and quantum sensing) and microelectronics.  Our experimental portfolio encompasses high-energy collider physics (ATLAS), neutrino physics (DUNE), direct detection of dark matter (LZ, TESSERACT), Mu2e, experimental cosmology (DESI, Rubin Observatory DESC, Type Ia Supernovae), CMB (Simons Array, Simons Observatory, CMB-S4). Chamberlain Fellows may join any of the active research programs, subject to funding availability.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**[Postdoctoral Position at KIPAC, Stanford/SLAC, Nov 1, 2021](https://academicjobsonline.org/ajo/jobs/19563)**

Applications are invited for several postdoctoral positions at the Kavli Institute of Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology (KIPAC) at Stanford University and the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory with a focus on Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) surveys. The positions are primarily intended to expand our work with the CMB experiments BICEP/Keck Array, the South Pole Telescope (SPT), Simons Observatory, and CMB-S4, but also to develop applications and methods in other areas of cosmology and physics.

We seek candidates with experience in data analysis, simulations, and/or instrumentation development in observational cosmology or particle astrophysics, and expect them to work in one or more of the following areas:

1\. Science analyses of data from current-generation CMB experiments, and if relevant, jointly with data from surveys such as DESI, Rubin Observatory, or intensity mapping experiments.

2\. Forecasts and systematics studies informing the design of CMB-S4.

3\. Development of CMB-S4 instrumentation prototypes and software, especially in the area of superconducting transition-edge sensors and their SQUID-amplified readout.

4\. Application of CMB detector and readout technology in new concepts for low-mass dark matter searches, THz photon sensing, and qubit-based sensors for physics.

Successful candidates will have ample opportunities to test their ideas on data from the South Pole Telescope and the BICEP/Keck Array telescopes, and to make significant contributions to the design of the next-generation CMB experiment CMB-S4. They will work with CMB scientists in the aforementioned collaborations and interact with the local CMB and cosmology groups, making connections to other exciting opportunities for measurements in cosmology and physics. KIPAC provides a stimulating intellectual environment for interactions with scientists pursuing observational, experimental, computational, and theoretical research relevant to the above areas.
