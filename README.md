**[Tenure-track Assistant Professor of Astrophysics, Illinois Institute of Technology,  Dec 31, 2023](https://iit7.peopleadmin.com/postings/10070)**

Illinois Institute of Technology is accepting applications for a tenure-track assistant professor position specializing in astronomy and astrophysics. The academic appointment for the position will be in the Illinois Tech Department of Physics with an expected start date of August 15, 2024.

Illinois Tech is a private Ph.D.-granting research university with world-renowned programs in engineering, computing, architecture, the sciences, humanities and social sciences, psychology, business, law, and design. It is ranked \#98 in the 2024 U.S. News and World Report National Universities category and \#1 in the state of Illinois and \#23 nationally in the Wall Street Journal America’s Best Colleges 2024. Founded in 1890, Illinois Tech was built on the promise to provide access to higher education for students from all different backgrounds and to make a difference in the world through technology-oriented education. This guiding mission and purpose – where students, including those underrepresented in technology, could prepare for meaningful roles in a changing industrial society and achieve professional and economic advancement – remains just as relevant today. As such, diversity and inclusion are part of the day-to-day experience at Illinois Tech and a central component of its culture. Illinois Tech is home to a diverse and global student population, is committed to providing opportunities to enhance the diversity of its faculty and staff, and strongly encourages applicants from all backgrounds to apply for this position, especially those underrepresented in the field.

A successful candidate will be expected to develop an internationally recognized astronomy or astrophysics research program, attract external research funding to support their program, advise undergraduate students, supervise graduate student MS/PhD research, and teach physics or astrophysics courses at the graduate and undergraduate levels.

**[Postdoctoral researcher in CMB Data Analysis with the South Pole Telescope at U Chicago, Jan 12, 2024](https://jobregister.aas.org/ad/b034ad8d)**

The South Pole Telescope project invites applications for a postdoctoral position in the Department of Astronomy & Astrophysics and the Kavli Institute for Cosmological Physics at the University of Chicago. The position will focus on analysis of cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from the SPT-3G camera. SPT-3G is the largest currently operating CMB camera, and data from the camera is being used to create the deepest wide-area CMB maps yet produced and to place unprecedentedly tight constraints on cosmological parameters. The successful candidate will take a leadership role in creating maps and other intermediate data products from raw SPT-3G data and participate in post-map analyses such as power spectrum estimation, CMB lensing potential reconstruction, and constraining cosmological parameters. The candidate will play a key role in analyzing the new SPT-3G Wide survey, which complements the ultra-deep Main 1500-square-degree survey and will result in major gains in cosmological constraints.
