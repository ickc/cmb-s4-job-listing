**[Research software engineer at SO:UK at Manchester, July 5, 2024](https://www.jobs.manchester.ac.uk/Job/JobDetail?JobId=29238)**

The Simons Observatory:UK (SO:UK) collaboration seeks a Software Engineer (SE) to work on the delivery of a UK-based data centre for Simons Observatory (SO). SO is a next-generation Cosmic Microwave Background observatory currently under construction in the Atacama Desert in Chile and due to begin early science operations in early 2023. The successful candidate will work with the SO:UK Data Centre Manager, and with the wider SO:UK team at Manchester, to deliver the UK data centre for this major international project.

The SO:UK data centre will be a major data processing hub for SO and will play a central role in the production and validation of SO’s Science-Ready Data Products (SRDPs). The SE position will make central contributions to these tasks. In particular, deploying, optimising and providing workflow management of the data analysis, map-making and simulation pipelines on the SO:UK data centre infrastructure, and contributing to the validation of the SRDPs, notably through analysis of null tests and supporting activities. They SE will also provide software engineering support to the wider SO scientific collaboration by assisting with the optimization and packaging of the SO software stack.

We seek candidates with demonstrated experience in developing pipeline software and managing pipeline workflows for the analysis of data from significant scientific experiments. They should have experience in high-performance and/or high-throughput computing on high-specification hardware. Working as part of the SO Data Management team, the successful candidates will collaborate closely with international SO colleagues in order to deliver on the overall objectives of the SO project.

**[Postdoc on CMB-S4 detection and data processing chain at APC/LBL, July 11, 2024](https://academicjobsonline.org/ajo/jobs/27549)**

The precise measurement of polarized fluctuations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) emission is a major objective of modern observational cosmology. So-called primordial B modes of CMB polarization, thought to have been generated in an early phase of cosmic inflation, would provide unique information about the origin of the Universe and fundamental laws of physics at very high energies. The faint amplitude of the expected signals, of order of a few nK, requires highly sensitive observations together with exquisite control of instrumental systematic errors that can be higher by a few orders of magnitude.

CMB-S4 (stage 4) is a 4th generation ground-based instrument aiming at observing these signals with ultimate sensitivity. To that effect, the experiment will deploy about 500 000 cryogenic detectors distributed over 85 optics tubes distributed in a few small (SAT) and large (LAT) aperture telescopes, which will observe from Chile and Antarctica. This will make it the largest and most advanced CMB observatory ever constructed. CMB-S4 has recently been ranked as the top priority for the next decade by the US Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel (P5).

The unprecedented sensitivity, precision and accuracy of the observations requires precise understanding of the instrument and optimization of the data analysis pipeline. The postdoctoral scholar will work on one or more of the following topics:

1.  Design and characterization of readout electronics using Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) and S4 sample detectors. A prototype of this detection chain will be installed and tested at APC in a dilution fridge.
2.  Development of an optical test bench to measure the response and the bandpass of detectors. An external Fourier Transform Spectrometer will be used together with a dilution fridge equipped with a window and optical filters. The precision of this testbench will have to be consistent with the requirements of CMB-S4.
3.  CMB-S4 simulation and data analysis to evaluate the scientific impact of instrumental and pipeline design choices and optimize the instrumental efficiency of CMB-S4.

The post-doc will work with the CMB-S4 project and collaboration, and in particular with Damien Prêle and Michel Piat at the APC laboratory in Paris, and with Jacques Delabrouille and Reijo Keskitalo at LBNL in Berkeley. The postdoc is expected to share work between APC, Paris and LBNL, Berkeley, as a function of project needs.

**[Postdoc in software development for ASO at Univ. of Pennsylvania, May 24, 2024, until filled](https://theapplicantmanager.com/jobs?pos=sm162&fs=1.0em)**

The Center for Particle Cosmology at the University of Pennsylvania is seeking applicants for a postdoctoral researcher focused on software development for astronomical surveys. We are interested in candidates with a keen interest in data-driven astrophysics and a strong background in software development.

The successful candidate will work within the distributed Advanced Simons Observatory (ASO) team, but will be based at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, PA, USA, under the direct supervision of Dr. Josh Borrow and Prof. Mathew Madhavacheril. This position is primarily technical in nature, with a core focus on software development. As such, we explicitly would like to encourage applications from candidates who are interested in transitioning from a PhD to a role in industry.

The role of the successful candidate will be to build, deploy, and maintain data engineering infrastructure for ASO within the Data Delivery group. This distributed infrastructure is responsible for both internal and public data releases, and ranges from web-based map viewers to large databases of simulation products.

For any questions, please contact Josh Borrow ([\[email protected\]]()). *For best consideration, please apply by May 24, 2024*. The position will remain open until a suitable candidate is found.

**[BICEP Array winterover positions, until filled](https://hr.myu.umn.edu/jobs/ext/361030)**

The BICEP winter-over scientists will start work in fall 2024 and deploy to the South Pole via New Zealand in late October or early November. They will remain at the South Pole through the Antarctic winter, until November 2025. Once the austral summer team leaves the site in February 2025, the two-person winter-over team is responsible for maintaining and operating the BICEP telescopes while science data is being recorded. 

The BICEP3 and BICEP Array telescopes represent an investment of approximately $30 million and 50-person years of effort by a collaboration of more than 30 people. The team plans carefully for every eventuality and many spare parts are kept on site. Nevertheless, the possibility for failure due to human error exists and has occurred in the past. Poor judgment or decision-making could result in the experiment being interrupted for the remainder of the winter season, resulting in major implied costs and loss of scientific competitiveness. The winter-over scientists will receive considerable support and guidance via internet and satellite telephone communications. Nevertheless, these roles requires exceptionally stable individuals who are self-motivated and able to communicate and take direction well.

**[Postdoc at KIPAC at Stanford/SLAC, until filled](https://academicjobsonline.org/ajo/jobs/27171)**

Applications are invited for a postdoctoral position at the Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology (KIPAC) at Stanford University and the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory with a focus on instrumentation for Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) surveys. The position is primarily intended to focus on the development of technology for the CMB-S4 experiment, but also to expand our work with other CMB experiments such as the BICEP/Keck Array, the South Pole Telescope (SPT), and the Simons Observatory. Successful candidates may also contribute to the development of technologies and analysis methods in other areas of cosmology and physics.

We seek a candidate with experience in instrumentation development to work in the following areas: 1. Development of CMB-S4 instrumentation prototypes and software, especially in the area of superconducting transition-edge sensors and their SQUID-amplified readout. 2. Application of CMB detector and readout technology in new concepts for future far -infrared and line intensity mapping surveys, low-mass dark matter searches, THz photon sensing, and quantum sensors for physics.

Candidates with prior expertise in low temperature or superconducting detectors and readout electronics are particularly encouraged to apply. Candidates interested in science analyses for cosmic inflation, CMB lensing and secondaries using data from current-generation CMB telescopes will have ample opportunities to engage with local expertise in related areas.

The successful candidate will work with CMB scientists in the aforementioned collaborations and interact with the local CMB and other HEP instrumentation groups, making connections to other exciting opportunities for measurements in cosmology and physics.  KIPAC provides a stimulating intellectual environment for interactions with scientists pursuing observational, experimental, computational, and theoretical research relevant to the above areas.
