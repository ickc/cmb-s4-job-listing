**[HIRAX Project Manager at UKNZ, Nov 12, 2021](https://hirax.ukzn.ac.za/hirax-project-manager/)**

The Hydrogen Intensity and Real-time Analysis experiment (HIRAX) is a major radio astronomy telescope slated for construction in a radio-quiet area in South Africa. It will detect the effects of dark energy on the distribution of galaxies, traced by their neutral hydrogen emission. Operating between 400 and 800 MHz, HIRAX will also be a world-leading facility for studies of radio transients, pulsars, and hydrogen absorbers. HIRAX is led by the University of KwaZulu-Natal, and so UKZN seeks to appoint a Project Manager who will play a critical role in its development.   
  
The Project Manager will direct the daily operations and manage construction and design requirements of HIRAX and the telescope site. The role includes the procurement of telescope hardware and building links with industry partners. The Project Manager will be responsible for the delivery of telescope sub-systems as per project timelines, financial and contractual management of the project, and the coordination of HIRAX project activities. The incumbent will report directly to the Principal Investigator of the project. The contract will be for an estimated period of 3 years.
