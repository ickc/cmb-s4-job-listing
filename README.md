**[Software Systems Engineer at MSU, Mar 9, 2022](https://careers.pageuppeople.com/782/ci/en-us/job/509461/software-systems-engineer)**

MSUs ICER and the MSU particle astrophysics and cosmology research group are hiring a software engineer to work on: ● A cloud-based platform to support time-domain transient-source data streams from observatories such as IceCube, LIGO, and the Vera Rubin Observatory ●Data acquisition and reduction for SPT-3G and CMB-S4 experiments.

This effort will focus on data produced by several large-scale facilities observing different astronomical messenger particles, including the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, a kilometer-scale neutrino detector at the South Pole, gravitational wave detectors such as LIGO, astronomical survey instruments such as the Vera Rubin Observatory, and cosmic microwave background experiments including SPT-3G and CMB-S4. The time-domain transient-source data processing will be part of the multi-institution SCiMMA project, and will involve collaboration with developers across multiple universities. SCiMMA is developing a distributed processing system that rapidly coordinates multi-messenger observations of neutrino, gravitational wave, gamma-ray, and optical events between observatories. The data-acquisition and reduction component will be a part of the CMB-S4 and SPT-3G projects and will likewise involve cross-institution collaboration. Work will involve the development of pub-sub systems for transient event alert distribution and experimental control monitoring, real-time data analysis and visualization tools for data and experiment controls, and data archival solutions. This work will also involve design and development of high-speed networking and software interfaces for non-pub/sub experimental data and distributed processing of the data collected. In this position you will: design, develop, and deploy high-throughput data acquisition and processing frameworks for CMB-S4. Design, develop, and deploy cloud based services for handling astrophysical multi-messenger alert streams from IceCube, LIGO, Vera Rubin, and other observatories. Implement automated systems for deploying data distribution systems and managing distributed consumers in a cloud and remote experimental environment. Design data storage systems to enable archival and bulk analysis of collected data and alert events. Develop, document, and extend data formats and develop conversion and analysis tools. Architect cloud-hosted JupyterLab data visualization environments to enable end-users to use the developed tools. On-site work is encouraged but remote work is possible.

**[Presidential Society of STEM Postdoc Fellowship at CWRU, Mar 25, 2022](https://case.edu/provost/presidential-fellows)**

At Case Western Reserve, we believe that great researchers can also be great teachers. As such, we have created the Presidential Society of STEM Post-Doctoral Fellows to be focused on excellence in the future of STEM teaching and research, with an emphasis on encouraging diversity, equity, and inclusion in teaching, research, and service.  We are searching for stellar individuals eager to build a community of STEM scholars who help define the future of learning for the next generation of students, the future of STEM research that crosses disciplines, and the future of diversity, equity and inclusion in all interactions including with neighbors and residents of Cleveland. This approach to scholarship and teaching and service is core to the values and approach of CWRU, as articulated in our strategic plan, [Think Big](http://case.edu/thinkbig).

The inaugural class of four Fellows will help co-design the future of the program, alongside the President, Provost, and Deans. We anticipate this program will ultimately grow to a community of eight Fellows at any one time. This three-year experience will allow Fellows to engage in research with key mentors, eventually moving into grant support with those mentor scholars by year three of the term. At the end of the three years, the Fellows will have taught STEM introductory courses, continued their research trajectories, built research partnerships across disciplines and into the community, published in their fields, and gained an understanding of how great researchers are also great teachers. Along the way, they will also be change agents at the university, building a culture that breaks boundaries, both visible and invisible.
