**[Postdoc in Cosmology at Cardiff, Jan 31, 2022](https://krb-sjobs.brassring.com/TGnewUI/Search/Home/HomeWithPreLoad?partnerid=30011&siteid=5460&PageType=searchResults&SearchType=linkquery&LinkID=6#jobDetails=1906541_5460)**

The ERC-funded project CMBforward at Cardiff University led by Prof. Erminia Calabrese is seeking applications to fill the position of Postdoctoral Research Associate in cosmology.

The research associates will work on characterization and interpretation of state-of-the-art Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope and the Simons Observatory, and will engage with the current efforts in designing a new CMB satellite mission. We are seeking researchers with an established track record in characterization and cosmological exploitation of CMB data.

The research associates will fit within the active and diverse Cardiff Hub for Astrophysics Research and Technology <https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/research/research-groups/chart>. Other members of the astronomy and instrumentation groups play leading roles in the search for signals from gamma-ray bursts, modelling and detecting gravitational waves, supernovae, cosmic dust, star formation and building the next generation ground and space-based telescopes.

**[CAPS Postdoctoral Fellowship at NCSA and UIUC, Feb 15, 2022](https://caps.ncsa.illinois.edu/get-involved/pd_fellowship_210215/)**

The Center for AstroPhysical Surveys (CAPS) at the National Center for Supercomputer Applications (NCSA) and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign invite applications from Ph.D. scientists for the CAPS postdoctoral fellowship. This independent fellowship is for 3 years and offers a competitive salary, benefits, and research funds.

This fellowship offers an opportunity to carry out independent research and to be connected with the vibrant research programs in astrophysics at the University of Illinois. Existing research programs at Illinois include the Dark Energy Survey (DES), Vera Rubin Observatory (VRO) and the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), SDSS-V, South Pole Telescope (SPT), and CMB-S4. NCSA leads data management and processing for the DES project with support from the National Science Foundation and is a partner in the construction and commissioning of VRO. Illinois is an institutional member of the SPT collaboration and participating in the design and planning for CMB-S4.

The selected candidate will be part of the new Center for Astrophysical Surveys (CAPS) at NCSA. NCSA is a hub of transdisciplinary research and digital scholarship where University of Illinois faculty, staff, and students, and collaborators from around the globe, unite to address research grand challenges for the benefit of science and society. There is a strong overlap and synergy between CAPS and the Departments of Astronomy and Physics. More information on CAPS can be found at [caps.ncsa.illinois.edu](http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/) . This year we anticipate prioritizing candidates with a research emphasis towards the long-wavelength regime and engagement towards CMB-S4 and/or ngVLA.

**[QUP Postdoctoral Fellowship at KEK, Feb 28, 2022](https://academicjobsonline.org/ajo/programs/21028)**

We are seeking candidates who are interested in our broad range of sciences and engineering. Our postdoctoral fellows are for three years with the possibility of a 2-year renewal based upon satisfactory job performance, continuing availability of funds, and ongoing operational needs, and provided with salaries comparable to those at other prestigious institutions. Applicants should have a Ph.D. in Physics or a related field by the time the appointment begins. We may offer a higher position, at the rank of assistant professor, for five years with the possibility of a 2-year renewal to outstanding candidates. Each appointee will receive financial support for starting-up research, and have opportunities to work with 13 initial PIs who are active in experimental cosmology, experimental and theoretical particle physics, data science, electromagnetic analyses, and device engineering. More information on their research activities can be found at the end. As a WPI research center, QUP is designed to establish an international environment where more than 30% of researchers are non-Japanese. English is the official language of QUP. We will build a diverse community of scientists, and we strongly encourage female and international applicants. About 40% of initial PIs at QUP are female.

QUP’s broad area of research led by 13 initial PIs include superconducting detector development and implementation to the LiteBIRD satellite, “Project Q,” a new project for new particle searches (including theoretical studies,) super rad-hard detector development and implementation to accelerator-based projects etc., development of new quantum field measurement systems beyond existing quantum sensors,a new device with quantum-field Casimir effects, innovation in analog-digital-mixed ASICs design, applications of machine learning to cosmology and particle physics, advancing systems engineering and systems science through projects at QUP

**[Process Engineer or Microfabrication Scientist NIST, until filled]()**

The Fabrication Project (https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/fabrication) within in the Quantum Sensors Group (<https://www.nist.gov/pml/quantum-electromagnetics/quantum-sensors>) at NIST (Boulder, Colorado) is seeking a Process Engineer or Microfabrication Scientist.  The Quantum Sensors Group designs, fabricates, and tests detectors and readout electronics that achieve world class performance for microwave, x-ray, and gamma-ray sensing. Low temperature, superconducting, and quantum phenomena are harnessed to achieve extreme performance metrics. Example devices include the Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID), Transition Edge Sensor (TES), and Microwave Kinetic Inductance Device (MKID). The Fabrication Project utilizes the state-of-the-art Boulder Microfabrication Facility (<https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/boulder-microfabrication-facility>).

  
Candidates are expected to have an advanced technical degree and micro-fabrication experience, including direct handling of wafers. Equivalent practical experience may be considered instead of an advanced degree. A background in low-temperature device fabrication is desirable, but not required. The successful candidate is expected to become proficient in a range of micro-fabrication sub-areas including CAD layout, lithography, physical vapor deposition, and plasma etching and deposition.  The successful candidate is also encouraged to play a major role in equipment maintenance, the acquisition of new equipment, process development, and the development and realization of new devices. We will consider both junior and senior level applicants. Interested candidates should contact Dr. Joel Ullom ([\[email protected\]]()).
