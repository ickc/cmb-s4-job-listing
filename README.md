# Job listings

This page is for advertising positions related to CMB research broadly defined, e.g., postdocs, faculty, laboratory and technical positions. To post positions, please send the description and link to [C. Reichardt]().

- [QUP postdoctoral fellows for LiteBIRD, until filled](#qup)
- [Chamberlain fellowships at LBNL, Oct 15, 2023](#chamberlain)
- [BICEP winter overs, until filled](#bicep)
- [Postdoc at NIST, until filled](#nist)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**[QUP postdoctoral fellows for LiteBIRD, until filled](https://academicjobsonline.org/ajo/jobs/25277)**

 We seek candidates interested in cosmic microwave background experiments with extensive experience in cryogenic instrumentation. The successful candidates will work with QUP Senior Scientist and project manager of QUP’s LiteBIRD activity, Hiroki Akamatsu, whose research focuses on developing CMB instrumentation for JAXA’s L-class mission LiteBIRD aiming for primordial gravitational-wave search. Our postdoctoral fellows are for three years, with the possibility of a 2-year renewal based upon satisfactory job performance, continuing availability of funds, and ongoing operational needs, and are provided with salaries comparable to those at other prestigious institutions. We may offer a higher position, at the rank of assistant professor, for five years with the possibility of a 2-year renewal to outstanding candidates.

 The primary research topic of the new position is the construction and accurate characterization of the LiteBIRD low-frequency telescope Focal Plane Unit (FPU). The focal plane subassembly will be based on Transition Edge Sensors bolometers and Digital Frequency Multiplexing technology. We expect to build and characterize the prototype (demonstration model) by 2026. We seek ambitious, highly motivated, and result-driven scientists. Applicants should have a Ph.D. in Physics/Engineering or a related field by the time the appointment begins. Excellent cryogenics instrumentation experiences are essential. A good command of the English language is necessary, and the fellow should be able to work independently and in a team.

**[Chamberlain fellowships at LBNL, Oct 15, 2023](https://academicjobsonline.org/ajo/jobs/25429)**

The [Physics](https://www.physics.lbl.gov/) Division at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) announces the competition for the 2024 Owen Chamberlain Fellowships in Experimental Particle Physics and Cosmology. The Fellowship is named after Berkeley Nobel Laureate Owen Chamberlain, who, together with Emilio Segrè, Clyde Wiegand, and Thomas Ypsilantis, discovered the anti-proton at the Berkeley Bevatron in 1955.  

The Physics Division has a long tradition of advanced instrument and detector development, computational research (including machine learning), cosmology simulation and analysis, quantum information (sensing and computing), detector R&D, and microelectronics.  Our experimental portfolio encompasses high-energy collider physics (ATLAS), neutrino physics (DUNE), direct detection of dark matter (LZ and TESSERACT), rare and precision physics (Mu2e), and experimental cosmology (DESI, Rubin Observatory DESC, Type Ia Supernovæ, Simons Observatory, and CMB-S4). For an overview of the research activities at the lab, please see [www.physics.lbl.gov](http://www.physics.lbl.gov).

**[BICEP winter overs, until filled](https://hr.myu.umn.edu/psc/hrprd/EMPLOYEE/HRMS/c/HRS_HRAM_FL.HRS_CG_SEARCH_FL.GBL?Page=HRS_APP_JBPST_FL&Action=U&SiteId=1&FOCUS=Applicant&JobOpeningId=355090&PostingSeq=1&)**

The BICEP winter-over scientists will start work in fall 2023 and deploy to the South Pole via New Zealand in late October or early November. They will remain at the South Pole through the Antarctic winter, until November 2024. Once the austral summer team leaves the site in February 2024, the two-person winter-over team is responsible for maintaining and operating the BICEP telescopes while science data is being recorded.

The BICEP3 and BICEP Array telescopes represent an investment of approximately $30 million and 50-person years of effort by a collaboration of more than 30 people. The team plans carefully for every eventuality and many spare parts are kept on site. Nevertheless, the possibility for failure due to human error exists and has occurred in the past. Poor judgment or decision-making could result in the experiment being interrupted for the remainder of the winter season, resulting in major implied costs and loss of scientific competitiveness. The winter-over scientists will receive considerable support and guidance via internet and satellite telephone communications. Nevertheless, these roles requires exceptionally stable individuals who are self-motivated and able to communicate and take direction well.

**[Postdoc at NIST, until filled](https://jobs.colorado.edu/jobs/JobDetail/?jobId=44413)**

The Professional Research Experience Program (PREP) encourages applications for a Postdoctoral Associate/Research Associate! The Long-wavelength Project within the Quantum Sensors Group in the Quantum Electromagnetics Division on NIST’s Physical Measurement Laboratory seeks a researcher to join a multi-person team to develop microwave kinetic inductance detectors and other novel devices for applications at millimeter to far-infrared wavelengths.
