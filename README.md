The cosmology group at USC is committed to providing a welcoming and vibrant intellectual environment for all. We are particularly interested in candidates who are underrepresented minorities and in candidates who will foster a commitment to improving diversity, equity and inclusion in the department.

The successful candidate will have the opportunity to participate in theory, simulation or data analysis efforts within the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, the Simons Observatory, CMB-S4 and the Rubin Observatory LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration. The postdoctoral researcher will work closely with Mathew Madhavacheril whose research interests include theory and data analysis of the cosmic microwave background and large-scale structure. They will have the opportunity to collaborate with other faculty and postdoctoral researchers in theoretical cosmology at USC.

Faculty members at Kavli IPMU are actively involved in experiments such as the Vera Rubin Observatory LSST, Simons Observatory, CMB-S4, and the LiteBIRD satellite mission.

Topics of investigation at Kavli IPMU include theoretical and observational cosmology, galaxy evolution, optical transients (supernova), numerical simulations, quasar studies, high-energy astrophysics, and multi-messenger astronomy. Large computing resources are available at Kavli IPMU and on the national level. Fellows have access to proprietary-period data of Subaru HSC and PFS. Fellows can apply for observing time on facilities available through the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ), including the 8.2m Subaru Telescope, ALMA, Keck and Gemini Telescopes through the Subaru Time Exchange program. Kavli IPMU provides a stimulating and supportive environment for junior scientists to grow with its mentorship program, large group of postdoctoral scholars, and interdisciplinary research opportunities with scientists from particle physics and mathematics.
