**[Phonon postdoc at LBNL, Dec 1, 2023](https://academicjobsonline.org/ajo/jobs/26504)**

The [Physics](https://www.physics.lbl.gov/) Division at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) has an opening for a **Postdoctoral Scholar** to work on the project titled “Phonon Control for Next-Generation Superconducting Systems and Sensors” under the guidance of the group leader. Their focus will be on the development of two main applications using ultrahigh-frequency phononics tools.

The first application aims to use phonon traps to enhance the performance of superconducting qubits in quantum processors. The scholar will utilize simulations to inform the design of phonon cloaking, collaborate with microfabrication engineers to produce the device, and conduct tests in the lab to assess its functionality.

The second application seeks to improve the performance of superconducting sensors, including Transition Edge and Microwave Kinetic Inductance, for high-energy physics experiments through controlled phonon propagation. Directing phonons in a targeted manner can significantly boost the sensitivity of these systems, potentially transforming fields like the search for low-mass dark matter and paving the way for new applications.
