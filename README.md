**[Postdoctoral Research Associate in CMB Foregrounds at Manchester, Mar 31, 2023](https://www.jobs.manchester.ac.uk/displayjob.aspx?isPreview=Yes&jobid=25047&advert=external)**

The Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics (JBCA), part of the department of Physics & Astronomy, seeks a Post-Doctoral Research Associate(s) to work in the area of CMB foregrounds. Manchester has significant involvement in several leading CMB and foreground experiments including the C-Band All-Sky Survey (C-BASS), Simons Observatory (SO), and JAXA’s LiteBird space mission. We are leading several areas, with a particular emphasis on astrophysical foregrounds and systematic effects mitigation. The focus will be on understanding and quantifying foregrounds emission using the latest data (e.g. C-BASS and COMAP), both for CMB foreground removal and for understanding the interstellar medium (e.g. emission mechanisms, Galactic structure, Galactic magnetic field, star formation). Ideally, we are looking for someone who crosses the divide between CMB cosmology and astrophysical foregrounds research. In particular, we are looking to develop a foregrounds pipeline for the LiteBird mission. The successful candidate(s) will have the opportunity to work on one or more of our projects, collaborating with our other postdocs/students, depending on their interest and skills.

**[Postdoctoral Research Associate at Cardiff, Apr 14, 2023](https://jobregister.aas.org/ad/6ee56e4f)**

The Astronomy Instrumentation Group (AIG) at Cardiff University is seeking applications for a new postdoctoral research associate in experimental cosmology. This position forms a central part of a UKRI Future Leaders Fellowship to develop and demonstrate novel superconducting detector technology and measurement techniques for line intensity mapping (LIM) at millimetre and sub-millimetre wavelengths (mm-LIM).

LIM is an emerging observational technique that can provide a new probe of large- scale structure (LSS) throughout the history of the Universe. LIM uses low angular resolution, spectroscopic observations of atomic or molecular emission lines to trace the large-scale fluctuations in the matter distribution. Knowledge of the rest-frame wavelength uniquely maps the spectral direction to redshift, leading to a rich astrophysical dataset that can be used to map the 3D distribution of LSS out to high-redshift.

The goal of this project is to establish mm-LIM as an independent probe of astrophysics and cosmology using large-format arrays of thin-film superconducting spectrometers. As the successful candidate, you will have the opportunity to engage with all aspects of the design, fabrication, testing, integration, and deployment of the first generation of ground-based instruments optimised for mm-LIM. Prior experience in these areas would be desirable, but not a requirement.

Working closely with PI Dr Pete Barry, you will join the SPT-SLIM collaboration, an international effort to construct a mm-LIM camera for the South Pole Telescope that is scheduled for its first deployment in Autumn/Winter 2023. You’ll also become a member of the MUSCAT collaboration, a bilateral partnership between UK and Mexican institutions to coordinate one of the primary receivers at the 50-m Large Millimeter Telescope in Mexico. Through these major projects, you’ll have access to a range of opportunities to undertake lead roles in the technical design, manufacture, characterisation, and deployment of novel spectroscopic focal plane technology, all the way through to the development of the data analysis pipelines and final science data products.

**[Research Scientist at NCSA, Apr 15, 2023](https://illinois.csod.com/ux/ats/careersite/1/home/requisition/3094?c=illinois)**

The National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) seeks a Research Scientist to join the Astronomy Group. NCSA uses a variety of local, national and cloud-based resources, as well as intellectual resources, to enable large scale observational science, such as the Dark Energy Survey (DES), Rubin Observatory, South Pole Telescope (SPT), CMB-Stage IV, and a number of future projects in development. The scientist will: support, build, and operate ambitious data systems for observational astronomy; engage in scientific collaborations and also the data science and engineering communities to help improve the state-of-the-art in data toolkits and techniques for observational survey science; develop and support challenging data production systems and apply data science techniques to current and future large observational programs; process and analyze data and participate in the overall operations and success of NCSA projects.

**[SPT winter overs, until filled](https://uchicago.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com/External/job/South-Pole/XMLNAME-10-meter-South-Pole-Telescope-Winter-Over_JR21076)**

The 10-meter South Pole Telescope (SPT) Winter-Over will be a member of a two-person crew located at the NSF Amundsen-Scott South Pole research station in Antarctica. The crew will be responsible for the hands-on maintenance and operation of the SPT. The crew will participate in the preliminary analysis of the astronomical data and is an integral part of the SPT collaboration. A continuous stay at the South Pole, lasting approximately twelve months, is required.

**[BICEP winter overs, until filled](https://hr.myu.umn.edu/psc/hrprd/EMPLOYEE/HRMS/c/HRS_HRAM_FL.HRS_CG_SEARCH_FL.GBL?Page=HRS_APP_JBPST_FL&Action=U&SiteId=1&FOCUS=Applicant&JobOpeningId=355090&PostingSeq=1&)**

The BICEP winter-over scientists will start work in fall 2023 and deploy to the South Pole via New Zealand in late October or early November. They will remain at the South Pole through the Antarctic winter, until November 2024. Once the austral summer team leaves the site in February 2024, the two-person winter-over team is responsible for maintaining and operating the BICEP telescopes while science data is being recorded.

The BICEP3 and BICEP Array telescopes represent an investment of approximately $30 million and 50-person years of effort by a collaboration of more than 30 people. The team plans carefully for every eventuality and many spare parts are kept on site. Nevertheless, the possibility for failure due to human error exists and has occurred in the past. Poor judgment or decision-making could result in the experiment being interrupted for the remainder of the winter season, resulting in major implied costs and loss of scientific competitiveness. The winter-over scientists will receive considerable support and guidance via internet and satellite telephone communications. Nevertheless, these roles requires exceptionally stable individuals who are self-motivated and able to communicate and take direction well.
