**Multiple postdocs at U. Chicago, Oct 31 – Nov 6, 2022**

[KICP Fellowship](https://kicp-fellowship.uchicago.edu/) (Deadline Oct 31) – KICP is an interdisciplinary environment that brings together physicists and astronomers ranging from experimentalists to observers, simulators, and theorists, to stimulate new ideas and push the forefront of cosmological research. Areas of active study include (but are not limited to) theoretical cosmology theory, observational cosmology, particle astrophysics, dark matter searches, and instrumentation.

[Margaret Burbidge Fellowship](https://astro-fellowship.uchicago.edu/) (Deadline Oct 31) – Open to all areas of astronomy and astrophysics including theory, simulation, observation, and instrumentation. Areas of active study include (but are not limited to) exoplanets, Galactic and extragalactic astronomy, high-energy astrophysics, cosmology, and computational astrophysics.

[Brinson Prize Fellowship](https://www.stsci.edu/stsci-research/fellowships/brinson-prize-fellowship-program) (Deadline Nov 3) – Open to all areas of astronomy and astrophysics, but with a focus on supporting research in observational cosmology, particularly complementing and capitalizing on space science, including topics such as the first stars, the cosmic distance scale, and the development of large-scale structure. The Brinson Prize Fellowship can be taken to one of four institutions including UChicago.

[The Enrico Fermi, Robert R. McCormick, & Mafalda and Reinhard Oehme Postdoctoral Research Fellowships](https://academicjobsonline.org/ajo/jobs/22604) (Deadline Nov 6) The Enrico Fermi Institute is an interdisciplinary research unit encompassing topics including: string theory and theoretical high-energy physics, experimental high-energy physics, theoretical astrophysics and cosmology, experimental particle astrophysics, infrared and optical astronomy, cosmic microwave background observations, general relativity and gravitational waves, and cosmochemistry.

[Instrumentation Postdoc](https://academicjobsonline.org/ajo/jobs/22567) (Deadline Oct 31) – This is a position working with Alex Drlica-Wagner and the instrumentation groups at UChicago and Fermilab to demonstrate the capabilities of novel ultra-low noise Skipper CCDs for applications in optical/near-infrared astronomy with future NASA/DOE missions. The position will involve a combination of laboratory testing, instrument construction, and data collection/analysis using the SOAR Integral Field Spectrograph.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**[Experimental Cosmology postdoc at UT Austin, Nov 1, 2022](https://academicjobsonline.org/ajo/jobs/23091)**

A postdoctoral position in experimental cosmology is available within the Department of Physics at the University of Texas at Austin. Candidates with experience in experimental physics or astrophysics are encouraged to apply. Particular areas of interest include millimeter/submillimeter optical metrology, cryogenics, instrument field-deployment, and balloon-borne experiments. The position will involve a combination of laboratory testing, instrument design and fabrication, and data collection/analysis.

The successful candidate will work with Prof. Nicholas Galitzki on one of several projects: \* Development of the cryogenic camera, optical system, and associated metrology techniques for the proposed Balloon-borne Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope Observatory (BLAST-Obs). \* Research opportunities within the CMB-S4 collaboration, specifically with the small aperture telescope design and associated technologies. \* Research focused on the implementation of the Simons Observatory small aperture telescope field calibration and the development of the associated pipeline and analysis software using data from on-site calibration and observations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**[David N. Schramm Postdoctoral Fellowship at Fermilab, Nov 15, 2022](https://academicjobsonline.org/ajo/jobs/23080)**

Fermilab is pleased to invite applications for the David N. Schramm Postdoctoral Fellowship in experimental particle astrophysics and cosmology.

The Schramm Fellowship is aimed at recent PhD recipients with a proven research record and prior experience in experimental particle astrophysics, cosmology, or closely related fields. This position provides the opportunity to bridge existing experimental efforts and participate in the development of new experimental projects. The successful candidate is expected to do original research that will capitalize on the scientific, computing, engineering, and technical expertise available at Fermilab.
