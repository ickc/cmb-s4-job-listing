Applications are invited for a postdoctoral position at the Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology (KIPAC) at Stanford University and the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory with a focus on instrumentation for Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) surveys. The position is primarily intended to focus on the development of technology for the CMB-S4 experiment, but also to expand our work with other CMB experiments such as the BICEP/Keck Array, the South Pole Telescope (SPT), and the Simons Observatory. Successful candidates may also contribute to the development of technologies and analysis methods in other areas of cosmology and physics.

We seek a candidate with experience in instrumentation development to work in the following areas: 1. Development of CMB-S4 instrumentation prototypes and software, especially in the area of superconducting transition-edge sensors and their SQUID-amplified readout. 2. Application of CMB detector and readout technology in new concepts for future far -infrared and line intensity mapping surveys, low-mass dark matter searches, THz photon sensing, and quantum sensors for physics.

Candidates with prior expertise in low temperature or superconducting detectors and readout electronics are particularly encouraged to apply. Candidates interested in science analyses for cosmic inflation, CMB lensing and secondaries using data from current-generation CMB telescopes will have ample opportunities to engage with local expertise in related areas.

The successful candidate will work with CMB scientists in the aforementioned collaborations and interact with the local CMB and other HEP instrumentation groups, making connections to other exciting opportunities for measurements in cosmology and physics.  KIPAC provides a stimulating intellectual environment for interactions with scientists pursuing observational, experimental, computational, and theoretical research relevant to the above areas.
