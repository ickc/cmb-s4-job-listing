**[Postdoc in data-driven cosmology at Arizona State University, Dec 23, 2022](https://apply.interfolio.com/115365)**

The Department of Physics in The College of Liberal Arts and Sciences invites applications for a postdoctoral position to work with Professor Simon Foreman on research in cosmology. The primary focus of this position will be on topics relevant to 21cm intensity mapping with the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME, https://chime-experiment.ca) and upcoming Canadian Hydrogen Observatory and Radio-transient Detector (CHORD, https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01777), such as the development of novel analysis techniques and theoretical descriptions of expected measurements. However, the successful candidate will have the freedom to also pursue other topics in cosmology relevant to the interests of Prof. Foreman and others at ASU, including but not limited to large-scale structure, gravitational lensing, the cosmic microwave background, and connections between cosmological observables and fundamental physics.

The successful candidate with become part of ASU’s Cosmology Initiative, which bridges the Department of Physics and the School of Earth and Space Exploration and spans experimental, observational, computational, and theoretical cosmology. The Cosmology Initiative includes research into the epoch of reionization with low-frequency radio observations (Judd Bowman, Danny Jacobs), the cosmic microwave background (Alexander van Engelen, Philip Mauskopf), theoretical cosmology (Matthew Baumgart, Damien Easson, Cynthia Keeler, Maulik Parikh, Tanmay Vachaspati), and other topics, and the successful candidate will be encouraged to interact with these and other researchers at ASU. This position will benefit from significant computing support, via ASU Research Computing resources and a group allocation for the CHIME Collaboration on a large external cluster..

**[Faculty Positions in Particle Astrophysics, Cosmology and Gravitational Waves at UC Riverside, Jan 1, 2023](https://www.physics.ucr.edu/about/employment-opportunities)**

The Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of California, Riverside invites highly qualified experimental physicists to apply for an Academic-year tenure-track/tenure position in the fields of Particle Astrophysics, Cosmology and Gravitational Waves. We have recently made new faculty appointments in experimental gravitational waves and experimental dark matter searches and expect to make two more appointments that will complement them.

Candidates should possess a record of demonstrated excellence in research. The successful candidate is expected to establish an outstanding and well-funded research program involving graduate students and postdoctoral scientists, and to contribute to departmental teaching at all levels. We are initiating a new experimental group at UC Riverside to augment and complement ongoing efforts in particle physics and astronomy. We are seeking independent researchers, who will build significant on-campus research efforts involving undergraduates, graduate students and postdocs on the forefront experimental programs in this general area of physics. We anticipate that individual hires may work together or on different experimental projects. We seek individuals with strong academic promise/experience, who can build significant research efforts at UCR in forefront areas that will complement existing programs in our department.

**[Faculty Position in astronomical instrumentation at PUC, Jan 13, 2023](https://jobregister.aas.org/ad/0c8be06a)**

The School of Engineering at the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, one of the leading engineering academic institutions in Latin America, invites highly qualified candidates to apply for a full-time faculty position at the Assistant or Associate level in the area of Astronomical Instrumentation (AI) at the Department of Electrical Engineering. Exceptional candidates in other areas of electrical engineering will be considered as well. The applicants must have a demonstrated ability and commitment to excellence in independent research and teaching. Previous experience in teaching and research, having led or participated in research and development projects, and having a technological or experimental approach based on the foundations of the discipline are desired.

The successful candidate is expected to carry out teaching not only in AI but also in topics related to the fundamentals of instrumentation, such as electromagnetics, electronics, control, and optics. Research topics other than AI, are also welcomed, especially with other disciplines of engineering, physics and astronomy. Main Duties: High quality teaching at undergraduate and graduate levels primarily at the Department of Electrical Engineering and conducting independent research are mandatory. Additional duties include knowledge transfer and outreach.

Requirements: Applicants are required to hold a Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Physics, Astrophysics, or related fields at the time of hiring. The search is open to all areas of astronomical instrumentation, defined as experimental hardware and software developments for the study of the cosmos and aerospace exploration. These areas include but are not limited to: visible and near-infrared spectroscopy and imaging, adaptive optics, millimetric astronomy, data processing and astronomical simulations based on high performance computing. The successful candidate will be affiliated with the Center of Astro Engineering (AIUC, www.aiuc.puc.cl), an interdisciplinary initiative of the Faculties of Engineering and Physics, created to promote the development of astronomical technology in Chile, taking advantage of the presence of major international observatories in the country.
