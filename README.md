**Three positions on SO:UK SATs at U Manchester, Dec 6-9, 2022**

The Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics at The University of Manchester is advertising three openings in CMB instrumentation. All positions are to work as part of the SO:UK team on the development of two additional Small Aperture Telescopes (SATs) for Simons Observatory.

Firstly, we are looking for someone with significant experience to take a leadership role in the overall delivery of the two-SAT program, including the full system testing of both receivers at Jodrell Bank Observatory as well as the site development in Chile. The successful applicant will be appointed as a Senior Research Fellow and the advert (due date Dec 9) is here: <https://www.jobs.ac.uk/job/CUX443/senior-research-fellow-simons-observatory-uk-project>

The second opening is for a postdoctoral research associate to work on two specific aspects of the instrument development: (i) setting the requirements for, and then validating the performance of, the Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KIDs) and their associated readout and (ii) implementation and testing of the half-wave plate rotation mechanism for both SATs. The advert (due date Dec 9) is here: <https://www.jobs.ac.uk/job/CUX477/research-associate-simons-observatoryuk-project>

The third opening is for a skilled machinist (Senior Technician) to support the project, to be based in the mechanical workshop at Jodrell Bank Observatory. The advert (due date Dec 6) is here: <https://www.jobs.ac.uk/job/CUX489/senior-technician-simons-observatoryuk-project>

**[Postdoc in Cosmological Data Analysis at Univ. of Pennsylvania, Dec 10, 2022](https://theapplicantmanager.com/jobs?pos=sm107&fs=1.0em)**

The Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Pennsylvania invites applications for a postdoctoral research position in cosmological data analysis. Our group is committed to providing a welcoming and vibrant intellectual environment for all. We are particularly interested in candidates who are underrepresented minorities and in candidates who will foster a commitment to improving diversity, equity, and inclusion in the department.  
  
The postdoctoral researcher will play a major role in the development of infrastructure for analysis of CMB data from the Simons Observatory and will also have the opportunity to participate in analysis efforts within the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) collaboration. The Penn cosmology group has an active presence in a number of other cosmological surveys, including the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the Rubin Observatory LSST.  The candidate will have the opportunity to collaborate with faculty and postdoctoral researchers at the University of Pennsylvania, including those working on CMB theory and analysis, CMB instrumentation and site infrastructure as well as those working on galaxy surveys like DES.  Candidates with at least one year of prior experience in CMB analysis will be strongly preferred.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**[Asst Professor in Physics (Astrophysics/Cosmology) at Southern Methodist University, Dec 15, 2022](https://jobregister.aas.org/ad/7d0c5d78)**

The Department of Physics at Southern Methodist University invites applications for a tenure-track faculty position in the area of Astrophysics or Cosmology, broadly defined. While an appointment at the rank of tenure-track Assistant Professor is anticipated, extraordinary candidates at all levels will be considered. Candidates must have a Ph.D. in physics, astronomy, or a closely related field; postdoctoral experience; and a record of research excellence. The successful candidate will develop a vigorous research program, supervise graduate students, and teach at both undergraduate and graduate levels. Faculty are expected to teach and mentor diverse students within the Physics program and throughout the University. The appointment will start in August 2023 or later.

Southern Methodist University is a research intensive, private university centrally located in Dallas, Texas. Current research in the Department of Physics at SMU focuses on the fields of observational and theoretical astrophysics and cosmology, especially in the areas of supermassive black holes, supernovae, early universe cosmology, and large-scale structure. SMU faculty are deeply engaged in DESI, Simons Observatory, and CMB-S4. The department also features strong research programs in experimental and theoretical particle physics. The Department of Physics aims to provide a collegial scientific community with equitable access and participation for all individuals and groups, and recognizes the value of this participation to the quality of our research.

**[3 postdocs in modeling and CMB data analysis in France, Dec 15, 2022](https://jobregister.aas.org/ad/f152a0e9)**

The French ANR funded project BATMAN (Better Accuracy and robusTness for Mass Assessment of Neutrino) is inviting applications for three post-doctoral positions in cosmology (two in Orsay, one in Toulouse). The project aims at using the combined current CMB observations with better and coherent modelling of astrophysics signals and systematics to constrain the neutrino mass and extensions of the standard LCDM model. 

Reionisation, large scale structures and CMB at the research institute of space astrophysics (IAS, Orsay, France) to work with Marian Douspis to revisit the constraints on the reionisation history from current observations and how it can be described by a generic model to be used as input in CMB probes of reionisation (TT damping, EE bump, kSZ spectrum), and upcoming 21cm observations. See [Description](https://batman-anr.ias.universite-paris-saclay.fr/sites/batman-anr/files/BATMAN_PostDoc_Reionisation.pdf)

Clusters of galaxies and large scale structures at the Institute of Research in Astrophysics and Planetology (IRAP,Toulouse, France) to work with Etienne Pointecouteau to revisit the state-of-the-art gas model in massive halos to build up coherent models for probes such as tSZ and kSZ power spectra, SZ cluster number counts and kSZ pairwise velocities. See [Description](https://batman-anr.ias.universite-paris-saclay.fr/sites/batman-anr/files/BATMAN_PostDoc_GasPhysics.pdf)

CMB cosmology and neutrino physics (IJCLab, Orsay, France) to work with Matthieu Tristram on the exploitation of the latest CMB measurements to derive robust and precise constraints on the neutrino sector including the neutrino hierarchy but not exclusively.

The Department of Physics in The College of Liberal Arts and Sciences invites applications for a postdoctoral position to work with Professor Simon Foreman on research in cosmology. The primary focus of this position will be on topics relevant to 21cm intensity mapping with the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME, https://chime-experiment.ca) and upcoming Canadian Hydrogen Observatory and Radio-transient Detector (CHORD, https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01777), such as the development of novel analysis techniques and theoretical descriptions of expected measurements. However, the successful candidate will have the freedom to also pursue other topics in cosmology relevant to the interests of Prof. Foreman and others at ASU, including but not limited to large-scale structure, gravitational lensing, the cosmic microwave background, and connections between cosmological observables and fundamental physics.

The successful candidate with become part of ASU’s Cosmology Initiative, which bridges the Department of Physics and the School of Earth and Space Exploration and spans experimental, observational, computational, and theoretical cosmology. The Cosmology Initiative includes research into the epoch of reionization with low-frequency radio observations (Judd Bowman, Danny Jacobs), the cosmic microwave background (Alexander van Engelen, Philip Mauskopf), theoretical cosmology (Matthew Baumgart, Damien Easson, Cynthia Keeler, Maulik Parikh, Tanmay Vachaspati), and other topics, and the successful candidate will be encouraged to interact with these and other researchers at ASU. This position will benefit from significant computing support, via ASU Research Computing resources and a group allocation for the CHIME Collaboration on a large external cluster..
