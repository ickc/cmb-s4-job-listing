**[Faculty position at FCFM, University of Chile, Oct 10, 2023](https://concurso-academico.uchile.cl/Postulacion/FM2304)**

The Faculty of Physical and Mathematical Sciences at the University of Chile announces an exclusive competition for women to fill one academic position as a full-time (44 hrs.) regular career appointment in the Physics Department. This position is open to all areas of physics, and applicants working in cosmology, for instance CMB physics, are encouraged. Our department ([https://dfi.uchile.cl](https://dfi.uchile.cl/)) hosts a Cosmology Group with two professors (Domenico Sapone and Gonzalo Palma) and several graduate students. The position involves a strong commitment to research, both individual and collaborative, undergraduate and postgraduate teaching, and it is expected that the selected candidate will maintain an active connection with society in their respective field. All of this through research and development projects, participation in postgraduate courses or diplomas, and/or outreach activities.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**[QUP postdoctoral fellows for LiteBIRD, until filled](https://academicjobsonline.org/ajo/jobs/25277)**

 We seek candidates interested in cosmic microwave background experiments with extensive experience in cryogenic instrumentation. The successful candidates will work with QUP Senior Scientist and project manager of QUP’s LiteBIRD activity, Hiroki Akamatsu, whose research focuses on developing CMB instrumentation for JAXA’s L-class mission LiteBIRD aiming for primordial gravitational-wave search. Our postdoctoral fellows are for three years, with the possibility of a 2-year renewal based upon satisfactory job performance, continuing availability of funds, and ongoing operational needs, and are provided with salaries comparable to those at other prestigious institutions. We may offer a higher position, at the rank of assistant professor, for five years with the possibility of a 2-year renewal to outstanding candidates.

 The primary research topic of the new position is the construction and accurate characterization of the LiteBIRD low-frequency telescope Focal Plane Unit (FPU). The focal plane subassembly will be based on Transition Edge Sensors bolometers and Digital Frequency Multiplexing technology. We expect to build and characterize the prototype (demonstration model) by 2026. We seek ambitious, highly motivated, and result-driven scientists. Applicants should have a Ph.D. in Physics/Engineering or a related field by the time the appointment begins. Excellent cryogenics instrumentation experiences are essential. A good command of the English language is necessary, and the fellow should be able to work independently and in a team.

**[Chamberlain fellowships at LBNL, Oct 15, 2023](https://academicjobsonline.org/ajo/jobs/25429)**

The [Physics](https://www.physics.lbl.gov/) Division at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) announces the competition for the 2024 Owen Chamberlain Fellowships in Experimental Particle Physics and Cosmology. The Fellowship is named after Berkeley Nobel Laureate Owen Chamberlain, who, together with Emilio Segrè, Clyde Wiegand, and Thomas Ypsilantis, discovered the anti-proton at the Berkeley Bevatron in 1955.  

The Physics Division has a long tradition of advanced instrument and detector development, computational research (including machine learning), cosmology simulation and analysis, quantum information (sensing and computing), detector R&D, and microelectronics.  Our experimental portfolio encompasses high-energy collider physics (ATLAS), neutrino physics (DUNE), direct detection of dark matter (LZ and TESSERACT), rare and precision physics (Mu2e), and experimental cosmology (DESI, Rubin Observatory DESC, Type Ia Supernovæ, Simons Observatory, and CMB-S4). For an overview of the research activities at the lab, please see [www.physics.lbl.gov](http://www.physics.lbl.gov).

**[Postdoc at KIPAC/SLAC with a focus on cosmology with millimeter-wave line intensity mapping, Nov 3, 2023](https://jobregister.aas.org/ad/7292b1bb)**

We invite applications for a postdoctoral position at the Kavli Institute of Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology (KIPAC) at Stanford University and SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory with a focus on cosmology using millimeter-wave line intensity mapping (LIM).

We are developing LIM as a new technique to probe the large-scale structure of the universe at high redshifts. As a lead institution in the SPT-SLIM collaboration—a pathfinder for LIM using on-chip spectrometers—our group is involved in all aspects of the experiment. We seek candidates interested in any of the following areas:

- Design and fabrication of superconducting spectrometer arrays, including R&D on new materials and spectrometer architectures in the Stanford Nanofabrication Facility.
- Characterization of spectrometer arrays, and operations and deployment of SPT-SLIM to the South Pole.
- Pipeline development and analysis of LIM data to constrain cosmology and astrophysics, including testing foreground and signal separation techniques.
- Developing the science case, instrument concept, and analysis techniques for future LIM experiments.

Previous experience in mm-wave instrumentation, thin-film superconducting device fabrication, or LIM/CMB analysis is desirable but not required. In addition to the international SPT-SLIM team, successful candidates will also have the opportunity to interact with KIPAC/SLAC scientists working on CMB (BICEP, SO, CMB-S4) and galaxy surveys (Rubin/LSST).
