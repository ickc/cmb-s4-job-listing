**[Postdoc in Galaxy Cluster Cosmology at Argonne, Aug 1, 2022, until filled](https://argonne.wd1.myworkdayjobs.com/Argonne_Careers/job/Lemont-IL-USA/Postdoctoral-Associate--CPAC_413433)**

The Cosmological Physics and Advanced Computing (CPAC) group at Argonne invites applicants for a postdoctoral associate to conduct research on topics related to galaxy clusters and SZ cosmology from CMB surveys. The successful applicant will be expected to work on projects connected to the SPT-3G and CMB-S4 cluster cosmology efforts, related cross-correlation activities with DES and Rubin’s LSST, as well as to explore their own independent research program. The position, with an anticipated start date (with some flexibility) of January 3, 2023,  is renewable annually for up to three years based on satisfactory performance.

Our postdocs can benefit from strong collaborations with cosmologists, applied mathematicians, computer scientists, device physicists, materials scientists, and statisticians; they will also have access to  world-leading supercomputing resources. Interactions with research groups at Fermilab, the University of Chicago, and Northwestern University are highly encouraged. For more information on the CPAC group and our activities please see: <https://cpac.hep.anl.gov/>.

**[Applications Physicist for Cosmological Surveys at Fermilab, Jul 22, 2022](https://fermilab.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US/FermilabCareers/details/Rubin-Observatory-LSST-Cosmological-Survey---Applications-Physicist-I_R_005716)**

This position is for an astronomer/physicist to play a critical role in the reduction of the data of LSST. The position entails working with the interim data facility on a Google Cloud platform and with the United States Data Facility (USDF) at SLAC National Laboratory, using workflows for the data reduction that span the USDF, the UK Data Facility and the France Data Facility. For the right candidate there are options to extend your responsibilities to survey strategy and progress metrics and/or to the DESC data production at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC). If you come from a physics background, we want to hear about data processing across multiple sites, the grid, or the cloud, about getting databases connected to processing, about data movement, about how you managed large campaigns of simulations or processing. If you are from an astrophysical background, we want to hear about experience in large surveys, about how you dealt with data flow from the telescope to the scientist, about databases and reduction software, how you work in large, distributed teams, and how fast you learn unfamiliar software systems that perform the astronomy you do understand. The position comes with a 20% research fraction for the time spent on Rubin operations.

**[Computational Physics Developer for Cosmological Surveys at Fermilab, Jul 22, 2022](https://fermilab.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US/FermilabCareers/details/Rubin-Observatory-LSST-Cosmological-Survey---Applications-Physicist-I_R_005716)**

This position is for a computational physicist to play a critical role in the operation of the Rubin Observatory United States Data Facility and the software that supports the LSST data production. The position entails working with specialized large scale data movement system Rucio (developed at CERN), combining it with the Rubin developed Butler metadata catalog and its Postgresql backend, to develop the system to handle data movement for production and the transport of metadata about the production back into the Butler. The role involves developing software for the management and tracking of campaigns of production for the yearly data releases. Expertise in Kubernetes systems and the deployment of infrastructure using infrastructure as code technologies such as Puppet or Terraform is part of the job of ensuring the distributed production system is ready for the differing needs of Rucio, the Butler, and production with the LSST software stack. The job is to make sure the complicated systems function for the data production scientists to move the campaigns of data through the system.

**[South Pole Telescope winterover, until filled](https://uchicago.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com/External/job/South-Pole/XMLNAME-10-meter-South-Pole-Telescope-Winter-Over_JR15347-1)**

The 10-meter South Pole Telescope (SPT) Winter-Over will be a member of a two-person crew located at the NSF Amundsen-Scott South Pole research station in Antarctica. The crew will be responsible for the hands-on maintenance and operation of the SPT. The crew will participate in the preliminary analysis of the astronomical data and is an integral part of the SPT collaboration. A continuous stay at the South Pole, lasting approximately twelve months, is required. The position begins in November 2022 and ends in November 2023.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**[South Pole station machinist, until filled](https://uchicago.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com/External/job/South-Pole/South-Pole-Machinist_JR15348)**

The South Pole Machinist operates and maintains the MAPO machine shop, which is located in the Dark Sector Laboratory of the NSF Amundsen-Scott research station at the South Pole in Antarctica. The Machinist works as part of a team to provide on-site machinist services to scientists and engineers from several universities. A continuous stay at the South Pole, lasting approximately eleven months, is required. The position begins 1/15/23 and ends 11/30/23.

**[BICEP winterover scientist, until filled](https://hr.myu.umn.edu/psc/hrprd/EMPLOYEE/HRMS/c/HRS_HRAM_FL.HRS_CG_SEARCH_FL.GBL?Page=HRS_APP_JBPST_FL&Action=U&SiteId=1&FOCUS=Applicant&JobOpeningId=347615&PostingSeq=1&)**

The BICEP winter-over scientists will start work in fall 2022 and deploy to the South Pole via New Zealand in late October or early November. They will remain at the South Pole through the Antarctic winter, until November 2023. Once the austral summer team leaves the site in February 2023, the two-person winter-over team is responsible for maintaining and operating the BICEP telescopes while science data is being recorded.

The BICEP3 and BICEP Array telescopes represent an investment of approximately $30 million and 50-person years of effort by a collaboration of more than 30 people. The team plans carefully for every eventuality and many spare parts are kept on site. Nevertheless, the possibility for failure due to human error exists and has occurred in the past. Poor judgment or decision-making could result in the experiment being interrupted for the remainder of the winter season, resulting in major implied costs and loss of scientific competitiveness. The winter-over scientists will receive considerable support and guidance via internet and satellite telephone communications. Nevertheless, these roles requires exceptionally stable individuals who are self-motivated and able to communicate and take direction well.
