**[PhD in combined data analysis for space missions at SISSA, Aug 1, 2024](https://www.unitn.it/phd-sst/884/details-about-funded-positions-40th-cycle-curriculum-1)**

The scientific case for Probe Combination in Astrophysical and Cosmological observations implies the development of analysis techniques which are capable of combining the different datasets from space missions. The research project concerns these innovative features of the analysis and focuses on the spatial datasets involving stellar populations (GAIA), the distribution of Galaxies in Cosmology (Euclid, JWST), in conjunction with Cosmic Microwave Background (LiteBIRD) and Gravitational Wave Observatories (LISA).

Please contact [Carlo Baccigalupi]() for more information.

**[Software developer for ASO at UPenn, until filled](https://wd1.myworkdaysite.com/recruiting/upenn/careers-at-penn/job/David-Rittenhouse-Laboratory/Sr-Application-Developer---Application-Developer-C--Department-of-Physics-and-Astronomy_JR00091703)**

The Center for Particle Cosmology (CPC) at the Department of Physics and Astronomy facilitates unfettered interactions and collaborations between the traditionally separate groups of particle physics and cosmology. Our mission is the connection of cosmology with new ideas in fundamental physics, directly testable both through the current flux of data from observational cosmology and imminent new particle physics experiments. The CPC is a key contributor to the Simons Observatory (SO), a millimeter-wave survey experiment currently being built for observations from the Atacama Desert in Chile, with a variety of scientific goals from probing the early universe to detecting millimeter-wave transients.

The role of the successful candidate will be to build, deploy, and maintain the frontends for data engineering infrastructure for the Advanced Simons Observatory within the Data Delivery group. This distributed infrastructure is responsible for both internal and public data releases, and ranges from web-based map viewers to large databases of simulation products.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**[BICEP Array winterover positions, until filled](https://hr.myu.umn.edu/jobs/ext/361030)**

The BICEP winter-over scientists will start work in fall 2024 and deploy to the South Pole via New Zealand in late October or early November. They will remain at the South Pole through the Antarctic winter, until November 2025. Once the austral summer team leaves the site in February 2025, the two-person winter-over team is responsible for maintaining and operating the BICEP telescopes while science data is being recorded. 

The BICEP3 and BICEP Array telescopes represent an investment of approximately $30 million and 50-person years of effort by a collaboration of more than 30 people. The team plans carefully for every eventuality and many spare parts are kept on site. Nevertheless, the possibility for failure due to human error exists and has occurred in the past. Poor judgment or decision-making could result in the experiment being interrupted for the remainder of the winter season, resulting in major implied costs and loss of scientific competitiveness. The winter-over scientists will receive considerable support and guidance via internet and satellite telephone communications. Nevertheless, these roles requires exceptionally stable individuals who are self-motivated and able to communicate and take direction well.

**[Postdoc at KIPAC at Stanford/SLAC, until filled](https://academicjobsonline.org/ajo/jobs/27171)**

Applications are invited for a postdoctoral position at the Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology (KIPAC) at Stanford University and the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory with a focus on instrumentation for Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) surveys. The position is primarily intended to focus on the development of technology for the CMB-S4 experiment, but also to expand our work with other CMB experiments such as the BICEP/Keck Array, the South Pole Telescope (SPT), and the Simons Observatory. Successful candidates may also contribute to the development of technologies and analysis methods in other areas of cosmology and physics.

We seek a candidate with experience in instrumentation development to work in the following areas: 1. Development of CMB-S4 instrumentation prototypes and software, especially in the area of superconducting transition-edge sensors and their SQUID-amplified readout. 2. Application of CMB detector and readout technology in new concepts for future far -infrared and line intensity mapping surveys, low-mass dark matter searches, THz photon sensing, and quantum sensors for physics.

Candidates with prior expertise in low temperature or superconducting detectors and readout electronics are particularly encouraged to apply. Candidates interested in science analyses for cosmic inflation, CMB lensing and secondaries using data from current-generation CMB telescopes will have ample opportunities to engage with local expertise in related areas.

The successful candidate will work with CMB scientists in the aforementioned collaborations and interact with the local CMB and other HEP instrumentation groups, making connections to other exciting opportunities for measurements in cosmology and physics.  KIPAC provides a stimulating intellectual environment for interactions with scientists pursuing observational, experimental, computational, and theoretical research relevant to the above areas.
