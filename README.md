**[QUP Postdoctoral Fellowship at KEK or Berkeley, Apr 30, 2022](https://academicjobsonline.org/ajo/programs/21028)**

We are seeking candidates who are interested in our broad range of sciences and engineering. Our postdoctoral fellows are for three years with the possibility of a 2-year renewal based upon satisfactory job performance, continuing availability of funds, and ongoing operational needs, and provided with salaries comparable to those at other prestigious institutions. Applicants should have a Ph.D. in Physics or a related field by the time the appointment begins. We may offer a higher position, at the rank of assistant professor, for five years with the possibility of a 2-year renewal to outstanding candidates. Each appointee will receive financial support for starting-up research, and have opportunities to work with 13 initial PIs who are active in experimental cosmology, experimental and theoretical particle physics, data science, electromagnetic analyses, and device engineering. More information on their research activities can be found at the end. As a WPI research center, QUP is designed to establish an international environment where more than 30% of researchers are non-Japanese. English is the official language of QUP. We will build a diverse community of scientists, and we strongly encourage female and international applicants. About 40% of initial PIs at QUP are female.

QUP’s broad area of research led by 13 initial PIs include superconducting detector development and implementation to the LiteBIRD satellite, “Project Q,” a new project for new particle searches (including theoretical studies,) super rad-hard detector development and implementation to accelerator-based projects etc., development of new quantum field measurement systems beyond existing quantum sensors,a new device with quantum-field Casimir effects, innovation in analog-digital-mixed ASICs design, applications of machine learning to cosmology and particle physics, advancing systems engineering and systems science through projects at QUP.

The LiteBIRD mission was selected by JAXA in 2019 and is scheduled to fly late this decade.  The detector systems are baselined to be delivered by the U.S. and will be partly funded by QUP.  The Low-Frequency Telescope (LFT) will be integrated in Japan, and the Middle- and High-Frequency Telescopes (MFT and HFT)  will be integrated in Europe.  The positions can be predominantly in the U.S. or in Japan.

**[Postdoc position in mm/submm detector development at Caltech, Apr 1, 2022 or until filled](https://academicjobsonline.org/ajo/jobs/21191)**

We are seeking to hire a postdoc to participate in the development of millimeter and submillimeter detectors. The successful applicant would have the opportunity to work on the development of detector technologies for continuum imaging and low-resolution spectroscopy in the 30-420 GHz range, possibly higher, for the study of CMB polarization, galaxy clusters via the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect, thermal sources such as dusty, star-forming galaxies and star forming regions and the ISM in our galaxy, and spectral line emission, including: 

-   microstrip-coupled titanium nitride and aluminum kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs)
-   crystalline and amorphous silicon as a dielectric for KID capacitors and superconducting microstripline
-   multiscale phased-array superconducting antennas for mm/submm wavelengths

 

The successful applicant may also join our effort on etched silicon metamaterial optics for these frequencies or observational work on the thermal and kinematic SZ effects in galaxy clusters.

 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**[Richard S Morrison Postdoc Fellowship at CWRU, Jan 2 – May 1, 2022](https://academicjobsonline.org/ajo/fellowship/20769)**

The position is expected to start October 1, 2022 (earlier/later start dates may be negotiated). Applications containing a CV, publication list, statement of research interests and three letters of recommendation should be submitted through Academic Jobs Online at <https://academicjobsonline.org/ajo/fellowship/20769>. If electronic submission is not possible, paper applications may be submitted to “Richard Morrison Post-Doctoral Fellowship Search c/o G.

**[Postdoctoral fellow in instrumentation for CMB experiments at Stockholm, Jun 15, 2022](https://www.su.se/department-of-physics/about-the-department/work-with-us/postdoctoral-fellow-in-instrumentation-for-cmb-experiments-1.608431)**

We are advertising a 3-year postdoctoral fellow position, to work with Dr. Jon E. Gudmundsson on a project in cryogenic optics funded by an ERC Starting Grant. The CMBeam program involves aspects in optical instrumentation, simulation, and analysis for experiments studying the cosmic microwave background, including the Simons Observatory, the LiteBIRD satellite, and the Taurus balloon-borne experiment.  
  
The principal aim of CMBeam is to advance aspects of cryogenic optics for millimetre wavelengths. Efforts include the construction of a state-of-the-art cryogenic holography facility for the purposes of testing optical systems of current and future experiments. This infrastructure will facilitate calibration efforts for upcoming CMB experiments such as the Simons Observatory and enable the development of optical measurement techniques that are critical for next-generation experiments.

 

Potential applicants are encouraged to get in touch with Jon Gudmundsson ([\[email protected\]]()) to learn more about these efforts.

**[South Pole Telescope winterover, until filled](https://uchicago.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com/External/job/South-Pole/XMLNAME-10-meter-South-Pole-Telescope-Winter-Over_JR15347-1)**

The 10-meter South Pole Telescope (SPT) Winter-Over will be a member of a two-person crew located at the NSF Amundsen-Scott South Pole research station in Antarctica. The crew will be responsible for the hands-on maintenance and operation of the SPT. The crew will participate in the preliminary analysis of the astronomical data and is an integral part of the SPT collaboration. A continuous stay at the South Pole, lasting approximately twelve months, is required. The position begins in November 2022 and ends in November 2023.

**[South Pole station machinist, until filled](https://uchicago.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com/External/job/South-Pole/South-Pole-Machinist_JR15348)**

The South Pole Machinist operates and maintains the MAPO machine shop, which is located in the Dark Sector Laboratory of the NSF Amundsen-Scott research station at the South Pole in Antarctica. The Machinist works as part of a team to provide on-site machinist services to scientists and engineers from several universities. A continuous stay at the South Pole, lasting approximately eleven months, is required. The position begins 1/15/23 and ends 11/30/23.

**[BICEP winterover scientist, until filled](https://hr.myu.umn.edu/psc/hrprd/EMPLOYEE/HRMS/c/HRS_HRAM_FL.HRS_CG_SEARCH_FL.GBL?Page=HRS_APP_JBPST_FL&Action=U&SiteId=1&FOCUS=Applicant&JobOpeningId=347615&PostingSeq=1&)**

The BICEP winter-over scientists will start work in fall 2022 and deploy to the South Pole via New Zealand in late October or early November. They will remain at the South Pole through the Antarctic winter, until November 2023. Once the austral summer team leaves the site in February 2023, the two-person winter-over team is responsible for maintaining and operating the BICEP telescopes while science data is being recorded.

The BICEP3 and BICEP Array telescopes represent an investment of approximately $30 million and 50-person years of effort by a collaboration of more than 30 people. The team plans carefully for every eventuality and many spare parts are kept on site. Nevertheless, the possibility for failure due to human error exists and has occurred in the past. Poor judgment or decision-making could result in the experiment being interrupted for the remainder of the winter season, resulting in major implied costs and loss of scientific competitiveness. The winter-over scientists will receive considerable support and guidance via internet and satellite telephone communications. Nevertheless, these roles requires exceptionally stable individuals who are self-motivated and able to communicate and take direction well.
